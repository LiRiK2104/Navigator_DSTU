# Navigator_DSTU
This application is my graduation project during my higher education for a bachelor's degree at the **Don State Technical University (DSTU)**.

### üìÉ Description:
This application was developed to perform 2 tasks:
- Assistance in navigation inside the 1st building of the DSTU;
- PR for the university through the use of innovative AR (augmented reality) technology.

In the normal state, the application works similarly to GPS maps. The user can view information about the classroom or other object on the map. He can also select point A and point B on the map, and the app will plot the shortest route between them.

In AR mode, the application is able to determine the user's location in space. This gives a number of additional features:
- Displaying virtual 3D content on top of the real environment;
- Ability to find the shortest route relative to your location.
